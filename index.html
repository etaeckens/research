      <h3> Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity for Unsupervised Adaptive Brain Machine Interfaces </h3>

        One of the major problems facing intracortical BCIs is that they tend to degrade in performance over long periods of time
        due to changes in the position of the neural recording electrode and changes in the actual neurons themselves.
        However, prior research has shown that lower dimensional neural manifolds can contain information about motor intent
        that stays constant even as the dynamics of individual neural units change.
        In this study, I aim to see if these low dimensional neural manifolds can be extracted by a spiking neural network
        trained with spike timing dependent plasticity, a biologically inspired unsupervised learning rule that strengthens connections between
        neurons with similar firing patterns. Early simulation results indicate STDP can enable recovery to neural disruptions;
        we are currently evaluating the limitations of this method and how its performance compares to existing methods.

        Spiking neural networks have been shown to achieve high levels of accuracy during neural decoding tasks.
        However, conventional methods of training SNNs for neural decoding use backpropagation, which can be quite computationally expensive,
        in addition to being infeasible for learning in an online environment.
        In this paper, we present a novel method for training SNN decoders continuously.
        Unlike backpropagation learning, the proposed method uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the duration of training,
        allowing for training on arbitrarily long inputs without stopping.
        We also test its ability to respond to neural disruptions in a simulated online environment;
        the continuous learning SNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the ReFIT Kalman Filter and LSTM decoder,
         after changes in the tuning of the neural inputs.
        Additionally, it also demonstrates the ability to train in a closed loop environment without any prior offline training,
        which could enable a more intuitive training procedure for BCI users.

        Nonlinear machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and LSTMs,
        have recently enabled neural decoders to reach higher levels of accuracy than
        previously achieved by standard linear methods such as Kalman filters.
        However, these machine learning algorithms are often quite computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for on chip use.
        In this work, we explored the use of spiking neural networks as a more efficient alternative to other machine learning methods.
        Spiking neural networks mimic the properties of biological neurons by encoding information in the form of binary sequences of neural spikes,
        and have been shown to be highly power efficient.
        However, due to the binary nature of their outputs, SNNs are not particularly natural for regression tasks such as predicting arm kinematics.
        I designed two modified readout functions to convert the spiking output of a SNN into a continuous, differentiable function that can model velocity.
        We compared the performance of the SNN to that of a Kalman Filter and LSTM on multiple public neural decoding datasets, and demonstrated that it could achieve comparable accuracy.

      <h3> Low Power FPGA Implementation of SNN Decoder </h3>

        One of the main reasons for interest in SNN neural decoders in the low power cost associated with SNNs.
        My previous work with SNNs was done in Python on a standard laptop; to actually realize the power savings associated with SNNs,
        the algorithm must be implemented in hardware. To do this, I designed an FPGA implementation of the SNN decoder using Verilog.
        This implementation uses event-based asynchronous programming to minimize the number of operations that are dependent on a clock.
        Due to the sparse nature of neural spike trains, these event based operations happen at a greatly reduced rate, with the potential
        for large power savings. The datapath for one neural unit of the SNN is shown to the left.

      <h3> Decoding Music from EEG with Audio Feedback </h3>
      <p> <i> Ongoing Project </i> </p>

      <p>
        Noninvasive neural decoding could of music could have significant implications for people with limited communication abilities, such as those with ALS,
        due to the close relationship between neural representations of speech and music.
        Neural decoding in other fields, such as motor decoding, has shown significant differences between
        open loop decoding and closed loop decoding, in which the decoder output provides feedback to the user.
        I proposed that real time audio feedback could be used as a "closed loop decoder" for music decoding from EEG recordings.
        This research is still in its early stages, but preliminary results suggest that simple linear decoders can differentiate between "expected" and
        "unexpected" audio feedback notes. We will be conducting a larger study in the spring of 2024.

        An important indicator of the health of honeybee colonies is sudden changes in population levels.
        Current methods of population tracking, such as weighing the hives, are imprecise and disruptive.
        We proposed that we could track honeybees entering and exiting a hive in real-time using a neuromorphic event-based vision sensor.
        This vision sensor responds to changes in light levels, rather than absolute values, which makes it ideal for tracking fast moving objects like bees,
        since the sensor automatically isolates the bees from the background.
        We developed event based algorithms to identify and track bees in flight, and have sucessfully tracked bees entering and leaving over the course of a day.
        Recently, we have also been exploring the use of event-based vision to track wingbeat frequency in real time.
        The wings generate a highly periodic sequence of events in the vision sensor that can be used to determine the frequency.
        This could be used to identify invaders, such as wasps, which would have a very different frequency than a standard honeybee.
